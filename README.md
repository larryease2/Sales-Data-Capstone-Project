## Observations
Revenue declined in the East and South regions while increasing in the North and West regions. The West market is experiencing low revenue generation. The company may need to investigate the causes of this decline, such as changes in consumer behaviour, economic factors, or competitive pressures.

Focused marketing efforts and customer engagement strategies may be necessary to revitalize sales in declining regions.
